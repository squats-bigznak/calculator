# calculator

The goal of this exercise is to create a functional calculator that inputs floating point values via buttons and outputs numbers to the display. The suggested method is to make the html/css first and then add the logic to it afterwards. 

I believe the guts of the calculator will be event listeners that will populate a string for the first operand, populate a string for the operator, populate a third string for the second operand, and then cast the operands to floats and submit it to a switch case that calls whichever function was requested via the user. It should all execute on "=" and then store the answer in the first operand and show it on the display. We shall see.
